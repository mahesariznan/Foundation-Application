/**
 * A composable that executes an [ImageRequest] asynchronously and renders the result.
 *
 * @param model Either an [ImageRequest] or the [ImageRequest.data] value.
 * @param contentDescription Text used by accessibility services to describe what this image
 *  represents. This should always be provided unless this image is used for decorative purposes,
 *  and does not represent a meaningful action that a user can take.
 * @param modifier Modifier used to adjust the layout algorithm or draw decoration content.
 * @param placeholder A [Painter] that is displayed while the image is loading.
 * @param error A [Painter] that is displayed when the image request is unsuccessful.
 * @param fallback A [Painter] that is displayed when the request's [ImageRequest.data] is null.
 * @param onLoading Called when the image request begins loading.
 * @param onSuccess Called when the image request completes successfully.
 * @param onError Called when the image request completes unsuccessfully.
 * @param alignment Optional alignment parameter used to place the [AsyncImagePainter] in the given
 *  bounds defined by the width and height.
 * @param contentScale Optional scale parameter used to determine the aspect ratio scaling to be
 *  used if the bounds are a different size from the intrinsic size of the [AsyncImagePainter].
 * @param alpha Optional opacity to be applied to the [AsyncImagePainter] when it is rendered
 *  onscreen.
 * @param colorFilter Optional [ColorFilter] to apply for the [AsyncImagePainter] when it is
 *  rendered onscreen.
 * @param filterQuality Sampling algorithm applied to a bitmap when it is scaled and drawn into the
 *  destination.
